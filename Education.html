       <p><h1>SEKOLAH KEBANGSAAN BUKIT DINDING</h1></p>
       <br>
       <p><abbr title="Sekolah Kebangsaan Bukit Dinding">SKBD
       </abbr>is a primary school located in Kampung Bukit Dinding, Jalan Jerantut/Temerloh, Pahang Darul Makmur. I went to this school when I was 7 years old as standard one student till standard sixth . This school is a school that consits of small number of students. As I remember at that time the amount of students are not more than two hundred. It is because this school are locating at the village area where they have a small population. During <abbr title="Ujian Pencapaian Sekolah Rendah">UPSR</abbr> I got 2A 3B.</p>

       <p><abbr title="Sekolah Menengah Kebangansaan Temin">SMKT
    </abbr>located in Jerantut, Pahang Darul Makmur.This school is providing education from form 1 till 5, and pra-university or form 6. As for form 6, it was divided into two categories such as lower sixth and upper sixth. On 2013 I entered this school as form 1 student until form 5. I took my <abbr title="Pentaksiran Tingkatan 3">PT3</abbr> on 2015 and <abbr title="Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia">SPM</abbr> on 2017. During PT3, I got 3A 3B 3C and 1E and as for SPM I got 5A 1B and 3C. Eventhough my result for PT3 not really satisfied but I glad because it was my effort and I has made a comeback for SPM. Notes for everyone, no matter how bad our result don't feel down because we can make better for future by learning from our past.</p>
