            <h1> WHAT HAPPENED IN 2021 </h1>
        <br>
        <h3>JANUARY</h3>
        <p>
            Starting on early January, I went to my hometown in Jengka, Pahang with my beloved family and we supposedly stayed there for a week. Suddenly there was heavy rain for everyday that cause we were stranded by the flood that struck at that time. That was one of best memories happened to me because I could experience how the other victims feel.

        <h3>FEBRUARY</h3>

        <P>
            On February just nothing much I did because that was my semester break and at the same time Malaysian citizens were ordered with Movement Control Order (MCO) where we need to stay at home and just allowed to go out if there any neccessary matter only. Oh ya! me and my siblings made suprise for my mother on her birthday, we gave her gifts and ate cake together. 
        </P>

        <h3>MARCH</h3>

        <p>
            On March I helped my relative to look on her daughter in Shah Aam which it located about 30 minutes from my house because of her babysitter applied for long holiday because she wanted  to give birth to her child. This month also I have to checked on my last semester result and Alhamdulillah I got dean list!!!! That made me extra happy because I have put too much effort on it.

        <h3>APRIL</h3>

        <p> 
            During April, I started my semester 4 of study through online. Students were given two options wether they want to going back to hostel or stay at home. As for me, I chose to stay at home whereas my course was not offer any subject that involve laboratory activities and other activities that involve the physical.

        <h3>MAY</h3>

        <p>This month my family celebrated my sister's birthday, we gave her gift and she really like it. This month also, we celebrated eid al-fitr in Selangor only because that time we were still in MCO phase where we not allowed to cross state. So, we just celebrate this eid with my small family and my mom cooked rendang with mee kuah ubi as our eid's menu. I am super love it.</p>
