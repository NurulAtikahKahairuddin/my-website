            <br><h4>
                <p>Hi to all readers, as shown above I shared a bit of my biodata,<p>
                    <p>so here I would like to share you all what I has experienced in my life.</p>
                    <p>During primary school I was appointed to be a school prefect,</p>
                    <p>that was great experience for me to learn on how to be a leader.</p>
                    <p>After that, I went to secondary school where on form 2, I also</p>
                    <p>was appointed to be a school prefect again. At that time I has implement</p>
                    <p>all knowledge I has learnt during primary school.Both were great experience</p>
                    <p>for me. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Other than that, I would like to share my experience when I went to holiday in Kuantan, Pahang.</p>
                    <p>It was bad or scariest experienced happened in my life</p>
                    <p>where I was drowned in the sea while at the age I did not know</p>
                    <p>how to swim. Luckily, I saw my uncle trousers and quickly I </p>
                    <p>reached for the trousers. Until now I will reject if anyone ask me</p>
                    <p>to do activities involving coastal areas.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>When I'm already finished my school phases, while waiting to enter university I worked as teacher at a childcare center in Seksyen 7, Shah Alam.</p>
                    <p>Working there gave me a lot experiences such as how to communicate with child, how to take care them properly</p>
                    <p>arranged activities for them especially sensory activities which it really important at their age to learn about sensory.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I think that's all experience I could share to you all. Thank you for reading!</p>
